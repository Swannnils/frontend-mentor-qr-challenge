## My process
I'd only few notions in front-end, so i made my way using the MDN Web Docs mostly and a little bit with Stack Overflow where i found help to make an hover animation. I coded this challenge with VSCode. I made the page in a different way compared of what was asked : i made the qr code section clickable , and added a hover animation wich trigger a box-shadow animation. I really like the end result.
### Built with

- Google fonts

### What I learned

I learned a lot with this challenge. I wanted to make this page in a way that it can adapt to the size of the window, so i learned a lot in css measurement units. I also saw the basic of css : this challenge was very useful to me.

### Continued development

I think i will re-do a newbie challenge or two to be comfortable with the basics of front-end, and next i will go more deeply into it.
